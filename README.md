## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore. <br>
This project focuses on the <href src=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who>Life Expectancy Dataset</href> from WHO.

6. unsupervised learning.ipynb

## Dataframes
1) Life: The original dataframe with missing values
2) Life_filled: the dataframe with imputed data, used for EDA
3) Life_agg: the dataframe with aggregated rows for each country for EDA
4) Life_tranform: the dataframe after skewness correction, **NOT** used in EDA, used for machine learning

## Problem statement
- to find out what factors affect life expectancy other than the obvious like region and GDP
- to see if there are relationships between previously unknown features and variables and that of life expectancy

## Models Used
1. Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
2. Logistic Regression
